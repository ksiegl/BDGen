The isotope file contains most of the pertenent information of the decay.

On the first line are the masses (in micro-amu) of:
M0 - The beta-parent
M1 - The beta-daughter
M2 - The BDN-daughter

And the neutron separation energy (in MeV)

abv is the beta-neutrino correlation, which is treated as identical between all branches.

The k-shell binding energy is in keV

The intensity for charge state, beta branches, and neutron states are normalized within the code.

The charge state list consists of integer charge states and their weight

The beta branches list consists of:
Energy(MeV)		Intensity	Populated Level index (in RIPL-3 data file of the beta-daughter)

The RIPL-3 data files are separate files specified when running the code, and are available at:
